# 🌿 Passable Leaves 🌿
It does what it says—lets you **run through leaves**! But wait, there’s more! Why just run when you can sprint, fall, and even FIGHT through them? 🍃

## 🚀 Features
- **Slow down** when running through those pesky leaves (because nature's speed bumps deserve respect). 🐢
- **Reduce fall damage** and speed when landing on leaves (more than 3 blocks), because leaves are the ultimate crash pad. 🍂
- **Fancy particles** when you land, like a nature-inspired fireworks show. 🎇
- **Sounds** when walking through them, because silence is overrated. 🎶
- Mobs? Oh yeah, they’ll **path right through leaves** too, just like you! 🐾
- Unlock the power of _**Leaf Walker**_ enchantment and **walk (or sprint!)** on leaves like the boss you are. ✨👣
- All of the above is **configurable**, because you deserve control. 🛠️
- **Mod Menu support** for configuration [1.18.2+ with Cloth Config]—because who has time to dig through settings? 🗃️
- **Smack your enemies through leaves** or hit them with projectiles, because leaves shouldn't get in the way of a good brawl! 🗡️
- **Compatible with Distant Horizon**, because who doesn’t love a good long view? 🌄

## ⚙️ Configuration Madness
All this power at your fingertips:
- **Falling distance multiplier**—how far can you drop before you go splat?
- **Falling speed multiplier**—slow motion or full speed? Your choice.
- **Walk slow multiplier**—sluggish or sprinty, you decide.
- **Jump slow multiplier**—moon gravity or... just jump normal? 🌕
- Enable or disable **Mod sounds**—your game, your soundtrack.
- Toggle **Enchantments** on or off—fancy enchantments, fancy you.
- **Particles**—on or off, get that particle sparkle! ✨
- **Player-only mode**—why let the mobs have all the fun?
- **Walk on leaves** without needing an enchantment—leaf walking for all!
- **Sprint on leaves** without needing an enchantment—because we love speed!
- **Keybinding behavior**—customize how and when you fall through.
- **Disable FOV changes** when in leaves, because sudden zooms are so last update.
- **Hide name tag** while hiding in leaves. Your enemies will never see you coming. 🕶️
- **Projectile stickiness**—set the chance that arrows and other projectiles get stuck in leaves. 🎯
- **Weapon hit through leaves**—whack enemies through foliage like a leaf ninja.
